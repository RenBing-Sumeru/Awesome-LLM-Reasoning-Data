Step 1 - Source the task substrate.
Input: programmatically generated charts with known underlying tables and code.
Operation: Normalize prompts, media, provenance, and reference fields into candidate records.
Output and transition: Auditable candidates advance to target generation.
Check / stop rule: Reject missing task inputs, source identifiers, or access terms.

Step 2 - Write the reusable target.
Input: Each normalized candidate and its source evidence.
Operation: language and vision teachers write questions and long solutions against program ground truth.
Output and transition: A serialized response, reasoning trace, or tool trajectory advances to verification.
Check / stop rule: Stop when the target cannot be linked to the prompt, teacher, or source evidence.

Step 3 - Verify and package.
Input: Generated targets and the paper's correctness metadata.
Operation: Apply program execution, answer checking, rendering validation, and difficulty/failure-rate selection.
Output and transition: Passing records form 1.8M verified chart QA pairs over about 800K unique charts stored as Parquet records plus referenced chart images.
Check / stop rule: Reject failures; do not treat final-answer agreement as proof that every intermediate step is correct.

Step 4 - Train and evaluate the consumer.
Input: The versioned release and the paper's base checkpoint.
Operation: Use the records for chart-reasoning SFT with a separate 40K RL subset and compare with web-mined chart QA and template-only synthetic chart sets.
Output and transition: A trained consumer and the controlled evidence reported by the paper.
Check / stop rule: Pin data, teacher, tools, prompts, model, and harness; stop claims at the evaluated domains.

Reproducibility requires the official data revision, generation settings, verifier/tool versions, random seeds, split, base model, and evaluation harness. Unreported budgets remain unknown.
