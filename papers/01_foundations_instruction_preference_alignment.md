# 🧱 Foundations: Instruction, Preference, and Alignment Data

> The older data objects that reasoning-data work inherits: instruction mixtures, demonstrations, preferences, reward models, self-improvement traces, and chain-of-thought prompting.

## 1. What This Track Studies

Read this category to understand how prompt-answer examples became richer feedback records with preferences, rationales, rubrics, and reward surfaces.

Reasoning-data papers make more sense when you can see their older ancestry. InstructGPT, FLAN, T0, Self-Instruct, helpful-harmless RLHF, Constitutional AI, UltraFeedback, and DPO all shaped the habit of treating post-training data as a deliberately constructed behavior signal. They did not solve verifier-bearing reasoning data by themselves, but they taught the field how to collect demonstrations, compare outputs, train reward models, and tune a model after pretraining.

The foundation category is especially useful for spotting what changed. A preference pair says one answer is better than another; a programmatic verifier can often say whether a final answer satisfies a predicate; a process label can identify the first faulty step; an agent trajectory can attach feedback to a state-action episode. Reasoning data inherits the engineering discipline of alignment data, then adds stronger structure around trace, verifier, environment, and terminal condition.

Practitioners should read these papers with a data-schema eye. Ask what the prompt source is, who authored the target behavior, what form the feedback takes, whether the reward can be gamed, and how the training objective consumes the record. The same questions apply later to RLVR and process reward models, but the answers become more domain-specific and easier to audit when a verifier or environment is explicit.

This page also guards against a common historical mistake: treating chain-of-thought, self-consistency, STaR, and distillation as just prompting tricks. They are also data-construction ideas. They show how intermediate text can be generated, filtered, reused, and trained against, which is exactly the habit that later open reasoning-data recipes make explicit.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 🧱 Instruction tuning / SFT data | demonstrations, instruction mixtures, and target-answer records | prompt sources and mixture weights are undisclosed |
| 🤝 Human preference data / RLHF | comparisons, scalar rewards, reward models, and human feedback pipelines | annotator or reward-model assumptions are hidden |
| ⚖️ DPO / preference optimization | direct preference learning and pairwise data as policy supervision | preference pairs are reused outside their collection context |
| 🧠 Chain-of-thought / rationale data | rationales, traces, self-consistency, and reasoning-style supervision | trace style is mistaken for faithful reasoning |
| 🔁 Self-training / STaR / Self-Instruct | self-generated instructions, bootstrapped traces, critique loops, and filtering | generated data collapses diversity or repeats teacher artifacts |

  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03816)
  _Data object:_ reasoning trajectory with intermediate search states; process: node state, rollout candidate, process reward score; MCTS-style reasoning tree
  _Feedback / verifier:_ process reward guided tree search
  _Recipe signal:_ generator: policy rollouts expanded by MCTS; filtering rule: process-reward-guided trajectory selection
  _Audit focus:_ search policy may overfit process reward artifacts, accepted traces can hide rejected rollout distribution, inference budget may be conflated with data quality
  _Why it matters:_ It shows how a process reward can guide search-generated trajectories, so readers can separate data generation, verifier choice, and inference-budget effects.

  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01377) · [Code](https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraFeedback) · [Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback) · [Card](../cards/releases/ultrafeedback.md)
  _Data object:_ instruction, candidate responses, fine-grained ratings, textual critiques, and derived preference pairs.; process: source dataset, model identity, response, rating dimension, critique text, corrected overall score.; offline feedback generation and reward-model training pipeline.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ AI-generated scalar and textual feedback over response quality dimensions.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: AI judge annotations and rubric instructions.; generator: candidate responses are sampled from a diverse model pool.
  _Audit focus:_ AI feedback can encode judge-model bias., A corrected dataset version can change reward-model behavior., Fine-grained scores may not translate cleanly into pairwise preferences.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a widely reused preference/reward data source, but its value depends on auditing prompt sources, judge model behavior, rubric dimensions, and corrected labels.

  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) · [Project](https://github.com/anthropics/ConstitutionalHarmlessnessPaper) · [Card](../cards/recipes/constitutional-ai.md)
  _Data object:_ original answer, self-critique, revised answer, preference pair, reward-model score.; process: principle used, critique, revision, comparison, preference label.; offline SL and RLHF/RLAIF alignment pipeline.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ AI preference model trained from comparisons guided by constitutional principles.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: constitution/principles plus critique-and-revision model behavior.; generator: model produces critiques, revisions, and response pairs.
  _Audit focus:_ AI feedback can encode model bias at scale., Principles may be underspecified or culturally narrow., A model can become safe-looking but evasive if helpfulness is not audited.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a core recipe for replacing part of human feedback with principle-guided model feedback, making critiques and preference pairs first-class post-training data.

  _Data object:_ instruction response with detailed explanation, intermediate reasoning, and final answer.; process: prompt source, teacher identity, explanation trace, task type, response, evaluation benchmark.; offline synthetic-data distillation and evaluation pipeline.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ downstream reasoning, exam, and benchmark evaluation rather than a single automatic verifier.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: large foundation models that produce explanation traces and stepwise guidance.; generator: teacher-assisted data-generation pipeline over diverse instructions.
  _Audit focus:_ Students can learn teacher style without robust reasoning., Synthetic traces can include teacher errors., Closed teacher data makes lineage hard to audit.
  _Why it matters:_ It is an early and influential reasoning-distillation recipe: the reusable object is teacher-assisted explanation data plus careful evaluation against style-only imitation.

## 6. What to Audit

- What exactly is supervised: demonstration, preference pair, critique, scalar reward, or rationale?
- Are annotator, judge, or reward-model assumptions disclosed?
- Can later reasoning-data claims be separated from general helpfulness or safety tuning?

## 7. Open Problems

- Which parts of classic RLHF data remain useful once a task has a cheap programmatic verifier?
- How should preference datasets expose annotator/rubric context so they can be reused as reasoning rewards?
- When does training on chain-of-thought traces teach reasoning behavior, and when does it merely teach trace style?
- Can self-generated instruction data be audited for lineage and diversity strongly enough for high-stakes post-training?
