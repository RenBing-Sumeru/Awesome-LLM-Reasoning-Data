# 🌐 Environmental Agent, Tool, Web, and SWE Trajectory Data

> Tool calls, browser tasks, app worlds, OS environments, repository-level software engineering, and replayable state-action episodes.

## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this page to learn how an environment becomes a data source: observations, actions, tools, traces, tests, rewards, and replay metadata.

Agent data turns reasoning from a static prompt-answer record into an interaction. A tool-using model chooses actions, receives observations, updates state, and eventually succeeds, fails, or asks for help. The environment is not decoration; it is the verifier-bearing substrate. In web tasks, it may be a browser state. In app and OS tasks, it may be a controllable software world. In repository-level SWE tasks, it may be a Git diff plus tests. The training record is often an episode, not a single completion.

This category collects the lineage from ReAct and Toolformer through ToolLLM, API-Bank, Gorilla, APIGen, BFCL, ToolSandbox, tau-bench, Mind2Web, WebLINX, BrowserGym, WebArena, VisualWebArena, WorkArena, OSWorld, AndroidWorld, AppWorld, OpenHands, SWE-bench, SWE-bench Verified, SWE-Gym, R2E-Gym, SWE-RL, SWE-smith, SWE-rebench, Terminal-Bench, and The Agent Company. The names vary, but the reusable questions are the same: what is the state, what actions are valid, what makes the task complete, and can the episode be replayed?

For practitioners, environmental data is attractive because it produces realistic feedback and naturally supports reinforcement learning. It is also expensive and fragile. Simulators drift, APIs change, hidden tests leak, browser pages mutate, and a successful trajectory may contain accidental shortcuts. Good papers document environment versions, task generation, action spaces, termination predicates, failure labels, and whether the same tasks are used for training and evaluation.

Read the full list with an engineering lens. A benchmark can become a training environment only if it supports reproducible rollouts and sufficiently cheap verification. A dataset of tool-call demonstrations may be useful for SFT but weak for RL if the environment cannot execute the calls. The category pages mark missing official URLs as `needs_search` to avoid inventing repository links for fast-moving agent systems.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

## 3. Subfield Navigator

  _Why it matters:_ It is a foundational agent-data pattern: the training/evaluation record is not just an answer but a trajectory of thought-like notes, actions, observations, and final response.

  _Data object:_ patch diff applied to a repository plus test execution results.; process: repository, issue, base commit, patch, FAIL TO PASS tests, PASS TO PASS tests, human validation notes.; Dockerized repository checkout and unit-test harness.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ post-patch unit tests plus human filtering of task validity.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: resolved GitHub pull requests and human validators.; generator: dataset curation filters original SWE-bench instances for clarity, solvability, and test validity.
  _Audit focus:_ Leaderboard scores can depend strongly on scaffold design., Tests may not cover all acceptable patches., Public benchmark tasks can become training targets over time.
  _Why it matters:_ It is now a central coding-agent evaluation surface because the data object contains issue text, repository state, proposed patch, and test-backed success criteria.

## 6. What to Audit

- Can the state, observation stream, action schema, and terminal predicate be replayed?
- Are tool wrappers, browser state, repository commits, and time/token budgets pinned?
- Are failed and near-miss trajectories preserved?

## 7. Open Problems

- What minimum replay metadata should every agent trajectory release include?
- How can benchmark maintainers refresh task pools without breaking comparability?
- When are generated environments realistic enough for post-training rather than merely curriculum pretraining?
- How should trajectories expose failed attempts so models learn recovery rather than just imitation of successful traces?
