# 🧮 Programmatic Math, Code, and Proof Data

> Math answers, code execution, unit tests, theorem provers, and verifier robustness studies where correctness can often be checked by a rule or external tool.

## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this category to study the cleanest verifier-bearing reasoning records: problems, traces, executable checks, proof assistants, pass-rate filters, and decontamination claims.

Programmatic domains are the workbench where many reasoning-data ideas become concrete. In math, the terminal predicate may be an exact answer, symbolic equivalence, or a carefully normalized solution. In code, the substrate can be a compiler, unit tests, hidden tests, or an execution trace. In formal proof, Lean or another prover turns a generated step into a machine-checkable artifact. These domains make the feedback contract visible enough to train with RLVR, filter teacher traces, and audit false positives.

That visibility does not make the data simple. Answer-verifiable math records can still leak benchmark items, reward shortcuts, or collapse diversity around familiar problem templates. Code datasets can overfit public tests, create brittle execution sandboxes, or reward solutions that exploit task wording. Proof data can hide massive retrieval and autoformalization assumptions. The useful question is not whether verification is automatic; it is what exactly is verified, what is ignored, and how the construction recipe handles uncertainty.

For builders, this category is the place to compare record designs. GSM8K and MATH made answer-level reasoning evaluation mainstream. HumanEval, APPS, BigCodeBench, LiveCodeBench, OpenCodeReasoning, and KodCode move correctness into executable code surfaces. DeepSeek-Prover, Goedel-Prover, LeanDojo, miniF2F, ProofNet, and HOList show how formal substrates can support proof search and reinforcement. Newer math releases such as OpenMathReasoning, Big-Math, DeepMath-103K, and NaturalReasoning expose post-training data recipes more directly.

Read these papers as verifier specifications. The paper title may say dataset, benchmark, or model report, but the reusable asset is often the contract: answer normalizer, test harness, proof checker, pass-rate band, source mixture, and filtering rule. Whenever a link is not pinned in local metadata, the atlas keeps the entry but marks it for search rather than adding an unverified URL.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

## 3. Subfield Navigator

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 📐 Math answer-verifiable data | math problems, final answers, solution traces, and answer checkers | answer extraction and normalization inflate scores |
| 🧮 Math RLVR datasets | math records used for rejection sampling, SFT, PRMs, and RLVR | data reuse and contamination are not reported |
| 💻 Code execution / unit-test data | code problems, unit tests, generated tests, execution logs, and repair tasks | flaky or leaked tests become the reward |
| 🧾 Formal proof / Lean / theorem proving | Lean, proof scripts, tactic environments, theorem statements, and proof checkers | proof succeeds only under an undocumented environment |
| 🧪 Verifier robustness and answer extraction | false positives, false negatives, checker brittleness, and adversarial formats | model learns verifier quirks instead of task skill |

## 6. What to Audit

- Is the answer normalizer, unit-test harness, proof checker, or execution environment reproducible?
- Are false positives, false negatives, and formatting shortcuts discussed?
- Are train/test split and contamination checks visible?

## 7. Open Problems

- How should math releases expose answer normalizers and verifier edge cases so downstream RLVR does not optimize quirks?
- Can public code benchmarks remain useful for training when hidden tests and benchmark refresh cycles are expensive?
- What is the right metadata for proof traces: informal proof, formal statement, search tree, failed attempts, retrieved lemmas, or final proof only?
- How much diversity is lost when data construction filters aggressively by pass-rate or teacher agreement?
