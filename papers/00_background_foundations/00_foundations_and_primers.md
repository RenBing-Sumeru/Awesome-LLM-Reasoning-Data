## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this track when you need the map before the terrain: vocabulary, taxonomies, historical lineages, and recurring audit questions.

This track is the front door of the atlas. It gives new readers a controlled way to understand post-training reasoning data before opening dozens of specialized papers. The goal is not to flatten the field into a generic survey list; it is to teach the reader which objects repeat across the repo: prompts, traces, answers, verifiers, rewards, judges, environments, metadata, and audit evidence.

The track combines field surveys with foundational alignment-data papers because modern reasoning-data work inherits older habits from instruction tuning, RLHF, preference optimization, chain-of-thought prompting, self-training, and data documentation. Those lineages explain why a reasoning-data release is more than a prompt-answer table and why every useful entry needs source, label, verifier, split, license, and contamination context.

Readers should treat this page as a routing layer. Extract the taxonomy first, then jump into the data-type tracks once you know whether you are studying demonstrations, preference pairs, programmatically verified outcomes, process labels, rollout traces, agent episodes, or rubric judgments.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

  _Data object:_ rubric-conditioned scalar score, critique, or pairwise preference output.; process: instruction, candidate response, evaluation criterion, assessment format, score/ranking, reference judgment.; open evaluator model, GitHub code, ACL software/data artifacts, and HF weights.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ Prometheus 2 judge output aligned against human/proprietary-judge benchmarks.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: human judgments and strong evaluator references across direct and pairwise tasks.; generator: training pipeline merges evaluator capabilities across formats.
  _Audit focus:_ Open judges can inherit rubric bias., Agreement with another judge is not the same as correctness., Pairwise and scalar formats can disagree.
  _Why it matters:_ It gives the atlas a concrete open-source judge model whose training/evaluation data can be audited instead of treating proprietary judges as black boxes.

  _Data object:_ instruction-response examples, preference pairs, verifiable task outputs, and model-evaluation records.; process: dataset shard, objective stage, prompt; open-instruct training/evaluation stack and Hugging Face dataset/model releases.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ mixture of preference labels, reward models, and verifiable rewards depending on stage.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: synthetic instruction data, preference sources, reward signals, and verifiable tasks.; generator: open data curation and post-training pipeline produces model checkpoints and evaluation artifacts.
  _Audit focus:_ Full-stack releases can obscure which component caused a gain., Evaluation suites can leak into data curation loops., Preference labels, reward models, and verifiable rewards should not be collapsed into one feedback type.
  _Why it matters:_ It is one of the clearest open references for modern post-training pipelines because it exposes data mixtures, objectives, decontamination, evaluation, and training infrastructure together.

  _Data object:_ model response, judge score, pairwise preference, or arena battle outcome.; process: question, turn, model identity, response, judge prompt template, score, preference label, bias-control setting.; offline judge harness and crowd-sourced arena platform.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ strong model judge and human preference comparisons.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: human preferences and strong model judges.; generator: candidate chat models answer MT-Bench and arena prompts.
  _Audit focus:_ Judge scores can be position-biased., Verbose answers can be over-rewarded., A model judge may share weaknesses with the evaluated model.
  _Why it matters:_ It is the standard cautionary reference for judge data: scalable model judges are useful, but position, verbosity, self-enhancement, and limited-reasoning biases must be audited.

  _Data object:_ instruction response with detailed explanation, intermediate reasoning, and final answer.; process: prompt source, teacher identity, explanation trace, task type, response, evaluation benchmark.; offline synthetic-data distillation and evaluation pipeline.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ downstream reasoning, exam, and benchmark evaluation rather than a single automatic verifier.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: large foundation models that produce explanation traces and stepwise guidance.; generator: teacher-assisted data-generation pipeline over diverse instructions.
  _Audit focus:_ Students can learn teacher style without robust reasoning., Synthetic traces can include teacher errors., Closed teacher data makes lineage hard to audit.
  _Why it matters:_ It is an early and influential reasoning-distillation recipe: the reusable object is teacher-assisted explanation data plus careful evaluation against style-only imitation.

  _Data object:_ multiple rationales and final answers for the same prompt.; process: sampling temperature, number of paths, answer extraction, aggregation rule.; benchmark prompting setup.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ majority or marginalization over sampled answers.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: few-shot chain-of-thought exemplars.; generator: model samples many reasoning paths.
  _Audit focus:_ More samples can amplify benchmark-specific shortcuts., Aggregation does not guarantee step faithfulness., Unmatched inference budgets can make methods look better than they are.
  _Why it matters:_ It is the classic test-time compute baseline for reasoning: performance can improve by spending more samples and marginalizing over traces without changing training data.

  _Feedback / verifier:_ AI-generated scalar and textual feedback over response quality dimensions.

  _Feedback / verifier:_ AI preference model trained from comparisons guided by constitutional principles.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: constitution/principles plus critique-and-revision model behavior.; generator: model produces critiques, revisions, and response pairs.
  _Audit focus:_ AI feedback can encode model bias at scale., Principles may be underspecified or culturally narrow., A model can become safe-looking but evasive if helpfulness is not audited.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a core recipe for replacing part of human feedback with principle-guided model feedback, making critiques and preference pairs first-class post-training data.

## 6. What to Audit

- Does the taxonomy separate data objects, verifier contracts, and training uses?
- Does the survey cite primary sources rather than only secondary summaries?
- Are missing metadata fields called out instead of smoothed over?

## 7. Open Problems

- Which taxonomy best predicts what a downstream builder should do next?
- How should surveys represent partially disclosed frontier-model data recipes?
- What metadata fields are essential for a living Awesome list to stay reproducible?
- How can Chinese and English learning routes stay aligned as the field changes?
