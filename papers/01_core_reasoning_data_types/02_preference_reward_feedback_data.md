## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this track to compare preference and reward signals before they become training objectives or evaluation proxies.

Preference and reward data is the bridge between demonstrations and optimization. It can appear as chosen/rejected pairs, scalar scores, critiques, reward-model labels, constitutional feedback, rubric scores, or judge outputs. Reasoning work often reuses these signals, but the meaning changes when the task also has a programmatic verifier or an environment predicate.

The practical question is whether the feedback contract is reusable. A reward model trained for helpfulness may not be a reliable verifier for math reasoning. A rubric score can be interpretable but brittle. A DPO pair can encode useful preferences while hiding annotator context. This track keeps those assumptions visible.

For high-quality curation, each paper card should state who produced the feedback, what alternatives were compared, what the reward optimizes, and where the feedback can fail or be gamed.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 🤝 Human preference data / RLHF | human comparison data, helpful/harmless feedback, and RLHF reward targets | annotator assumptions and disagreement are hidden |
| ⚖️ DPO / preference optimization | pairwise data used directly for preference optimization | preference pairs are reused outside collection context |
| 🎚️ Scalar reward / ORM data | outcome reward labels, scalar scores, and trained reward-model targets | scalar reward hides why an answer is better |
| 🤖 RLAIF / synthetic feedback | model-generated preferences, critiques, and constitutional feedback | synthetic judge behavior is treated as human preference |
| 🧪 Reward-model benchmarks | rewardbench-style evaluation data and reward-model stress tests | benchmark preference does not predict downstream training value |

  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) · [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yacmpz84TH) · [Card](../../cards/agents/toolformer.md)
  _Data object:_ text sequence with inserted API call and tool result markup.; process: candidate call location, API name, arguments, tool output, likelihood improvement, retained annotation.; external tool APIs used during data construction and evaluation.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ language-model likelihood improvement after including tool result.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: small hand-written demonstrations per tool seed the API-call format.; generator: model samples candidate tool calls over raw text.
  _Audit focus:_ Likelihood improvement may not equal truthful tool use., Tools can return stale or wrong outputs., The model can learn call syntax without robust tool-selection judgment.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a classic construction recipe for tool-call supervision: models learn when to call tools, what arguments to pass, and how to fold observations back into text.

  _Audit focus:_ A model can be uninformative but truthful., A model can sound confident while reproducing a human misconception., Multiple-choice and generation modes can lead to different conclusions.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a canonical truthfulness audit surface for reasoning models because stronger generation can still amplify persuasive false answers learned from web text.

## 6. What to Audit

- What exactly is supervised: demonstration, preference pair, critique, scalar reward, or rationale?
- Are annotator, judge, or reward-model assumptions disclosed?
- Can the preference/reward signal be reused outside the original prompt distribution without reward hacking?

## 7. Open Problems

- Which preference signals remain useful once a cheap programmatic verifier exists?
- How should reward datasets disclose annotator and judge assumptions?
- Can AI feedback be made auditable enough for open reasoning-data releases?
- What evidence shows a reward improves real reasoning rather than stylistic compliance?
