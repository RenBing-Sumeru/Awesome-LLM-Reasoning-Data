# 🔁 Rollout, Search, and Test-Time Trace Data

> Multiple rollouts, search trees, best-of-N samples, self-consistency traces, MCTS records, selected/rejected candidates, and test-time compute logs.

## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this track when the important data is not one answer but a set of sampled attempts, search paths, selector scores, or inference-budget traces.

A growing part of reasoning data is produced by search. A model samples many attempts, a verifier or value function scores them, and the system keeps accepted candidates, sometimes with rejected traces, budgets, tree nodes, or pass-rate bands. These records connect data construction, process supervision, RLVR, and test-time compute.

This track exists because search traces are often hidden inside other categories. If a paper relies on best-of-N, self-consistency, MCTS, rejection sampling, long-to-short reasoning, or repeated sampling, contributors should record the rollout budget and selector, not just the final chosen answer.

For curation, the most important audit question is attribution: did performance improve because of better data, more samples, a stronger verifier, a different optimizer, or a larger inference budget?

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

## 3. Subfield Navigator

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 🎲 Multiple rollouts / best-of-N | sets of sampled attempts and selected accepted answers | only accepted traces are visible |
| 🌳 Search trees / MCTS | tree search, MCTS, verifier-guided search, and path selection | tree policy or value model is hidden |
| 🔎 Rejection sampling traces | accepted and rejected candidates produced during filtering | rejected examples are not released |
| 🧠 Self-consistency / repeated sampling | vote-based or agreement-based reasoning from repeated samples | sampling budget is not comparable |
| ⏱️ Test-time compute logs | thinking budgets, inference-time scaling, and runtime search traces | training and inference budget effects are conflated |
| ✂️ Long2short / distill-from-search | using long search traces to train shorter or cheaper behavior | teacher search artifacts become hidden data lineage |

## 6. What to Audit

- Are accepted and rejected rollouts both visible enough to audit selector behavior?
- Is pass@k, search budget, sampling temperature, verifier score, or tree-search policy disclosed?
- Can gains be attributed to data, search, verifier, or inference budget rather than a hidden scaffold?

## 7. Open Problems

- How much of a reasoning-data gain comes from search rather than the final dataset?
- Should open releases include rejected rollouts and search trees by default?
- How can pass@k and training-data scale be compared fairly?
- Can selector behavior be audited without exposing proprietary verifier details?
