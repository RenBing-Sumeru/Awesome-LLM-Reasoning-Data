## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this track to understand what an evaluation surface measures and whether it can safely become a feedback source.

Benchmarks are not just scoreboards. In post-training reasoning, a benchmark can become a verifier, a filtering tool, a reward source, a test-time selection criterion, or a contamination risk. This track organizes evaluation surfaces by feedback contract and audit risk.

A good benchmark page should identify whether scoring is programmatic, environmental, judgment-required, mixed, live, hidden, or expert-driven. It should also state what happens if the benchmark becomes part of training data or public prompt pools.

For contributors, the goal is to make benchmark entries useful to builders: what can be scored, what can leak, what can be replayed, and what should not be reused as reward without extra checks.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

## 3. Subfield Navigator

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 📐 Math benchmarks | math problem sets, answer extraction, verifier compatibility, and difficulty | short-answer normalization hides reasoning errors |
| 💻 Code benchmarks | coding tasks, generated tests, hidden tests, repair tasks, and live coding | unit tests are brittle, leaked, or too narrow |
| 🧾 Proof benchmarks | formal proof datasets, proof assistants, theorem statements, and checking | proof checker version and imports are not pinned |
| 🌐 Agent benchmarks | web, tool, OS, app, and SWE environments with terminal predicates | benchmark episodes cannot be replayed |
| ⚖️ Rubric/domain benchmarks | medical, safety, legal, finance, science, factuality, and expert rubrics | rubric or judge expertise is insufficiently disclosed |
| 🧪 Reward-model benchmarks | reward model, LLM-judge, PRM, and rubric evaluation suites | benchmark reward preference does not reflect training value |
| 🧯 Live / contamination-resistant benchmarks | live, refreshed, hidden, or contamination-aware evaluation | static benchmark becomes a training target |

## 6. What to Audit

- What does the benchmark measure and what feedback can it support?
- Is scoring objective, human-judged, LLM-judged, or mixed?
- How does the benchmark handle refresh, contamination, and hidden tests?

## 7. Open Problems

- Which benchmarks are still useful after becoming public training targets?
- How should live benchmarks expose enough information for trust without leaking answers?
- Can reward-model and PRM benchmarks predict downstream training value?
- How should agent benchmarks standardize replay metadata?
