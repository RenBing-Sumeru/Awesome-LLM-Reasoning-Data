## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this track to learn how reasoning datasets are actually built, filtered, packaged, and released.

A high-impact Awesome repo must teach recipes, not just cite papers. This track collects the construction pipeline: task sourcing, teacher trace generation, rollout/search expansion, rejection sampling, self-improvement, verifier refresh, filtering, deduplication, decontamination, release packaging, and metadata.

Open releases vary widely. Some expose data and scripts; others expose only a report. Contributors should identify what is reproducible and what is hidden: teacher models, sampling rules, prompts, filters, accepted/rejected traces, splits, license, lineage, and known failures.

This track is where students can turn a paper into operational knowledge: what should another lab do if it wants to build a similar dataset?

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

## 3. Subfield Navigator

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 🧱 Prompt sourcing | question pools, seed sources, licenses, difficulty, and base-model pass rates | prompt sources are mixed without attribution |
| ✍️ Teacher trace generation | teacher models, trace policies, sampling settings, and distillation targets | teacher identity or sampling protocol is hidden |
| 🔎 Rejection sampling / search-generated data | candidate generation, search budget, filtering, and accepted/rejected examples | only accepted traces are released |
| 🔁 Self-play / self-improvement | self-improvement, co-evolution, generator-verifier cycles, and curricula | feedback loop amplifies hidden shortcuts |
| 🧪 Filtering and verifier refresh | answer filters, judge filters, decontamination, and verifier updates | filter thresholds become hidden objectives |
| 🏗️ Open reasoning data releases | open datasets, code, HF releases, recipes, ablations, and reproducibility | dataset is open but recipe details are not |
| 🧬 Data lineage and release metadata | datasheets, splits, lineage, licensing, versioning, and known failures | reuse loses the release context |

  _Why it matters:_ Verified citation waypoint; add a paper-specific data-object, verifier, and audit note before promoting it as a core read.

## 6. What to Audit

- Are prompt sources, teacher models, sampling rules, and filters disclosed?
- Can another team reproduce the accepted and rejected examples?
- Is the release license and lineage clear enough for reuse?

## 7. Open Problems

- What is the minimum release metadata for safe reuse?
- Should rejected traces be released as first-class data?
- How can open projects document proprietary teacher effects?
- Which filtering rules become hidden training objectives?
