## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this track to interpret claims about how much data, verifier strength, RL, and inference budget contribute to reasoning gains.

Scaling claims are central to modern reasoning models. Papers report more data, stronger verifiers, larger rollout budgets, better RL optimization, longer thinking, and better pass@k. This track helps readers separate those factors instead of treating every gain as a generic reasoning-data improvement.

RLVR makes the data/verifier link especially visible. A verifier can generate reward, filter samples, guide search, and evaluate final answers. The same benchmark can also become a training target. Good curation records the reward contract, data reuse, rollout policy, and inference budget.

For high-impact use, this track should become the place readers visit before believing a scaling curve.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

## 3. Subfield Navigator

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 📈 Data scaling | number, diversity, difficulty, and uniqueness of examples | unique examples and repeated rollouts are conflated |
| 🔁 Data reuse and uniqueness | reuse counts, deduplication, repeated prompts, and train/test overlap | same source examples are counted as fresh data |
| ⏱️ Test-time compute | sampling, search, self-critique, thinking budgets, and inference-time scaling | different inference budgets are compared |
| 🎲 pass@k / sampling budget | pass@k, repeated sampling, best-of-N, and budget-aware evaluation | reported gains hide selection or budget changes |
| 🧪 Verifier scaling | how verifier strength, refresh, and coverage scale with training | verifier becomes stale or easy to exploit |
| 🏋️ RLVR optimization scaling | policy optimization, reward contracts, curriculum, and rollout policy | optimizer/scaffold gains are mistaken for data gains |
| 🔍 Scaling attribution | separating data, verifier, optimizer, model, and inference-budget effects | ablation tables do not isolate the source of improvement |

  _Data object:_ problem-solution pair with natural-language mathematical reasoning and final answer.; process: source problem, augmented problem, generated solution, teacher model, filtering metadata, dataset split.; NVIDIA NeMo-Skills generation, training, and evaluation pipeline.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ answer checks and benchmark evaluation over math tasks.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: Llama3.1-405B-Instruct generates large-scale math solutions.; generator: NeMo-Skills pipeline performs problem/solution augmentation and model training.
  _Audit focus:_ Synthetic solutions can encode teacher shortcuts., Large scale can hide duplicated or near-duplicated questions., Verbose traces may hurt rather than help SFT.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a major open math-data release for studying teacher strength, solution format, question diversity, and SFT scaling in reasoning models.

  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01943) · [Venue](https://colmweb.org/2025/AcceptedPapers.html) · [Code](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills) · [Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenCodeReasoning) · [Card](../../cards/releases/opencodereasoning.md)
  _Data object:_ Python competitive-programming response with reasoning trace, final code block, and extracted solution code.; process: id, input, output; Offline SFT corpus for competitive-programming code reasoning; unit-test/code-execution substrate is used in ablations and benchmark evaluation.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ Format filters for reasoning traces and code blocks, Tree-sitter syntax parsing, benchmark-contamination checks with embedding similarity plus LLM/manual review, and unit-test execution for CodeContests ablation; final release is not strictly execution-filtered.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: DeepSeek-R1.; generator: DeepSeek-R1 generations served through SGLang.
  _Audit focus:_ Syntax-valid code is not necessarily semantically correct., Final release is not guaranteed to contain only unit-test-passing solutions., Incorrect teacher solutions may still transfer useful patterns but can also teach wrong reasoning.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a strong construction-recipe entry for code reasoning data because it exposes the source mixture, teacher-trace generation setup, post-processing filters, released HF fields, and an important negative result that execution filtering alone can reduce downstream benchmark performance by removing hard or diverse samples.

  _Data object:_ Repository-level SWE task instance with problem statement, repo, base commit, patch/test patch metadata, FAIL TO PASS/PASS TO PASS tests, and optional message/action trajectories.; process: repo and base commit, problem statement, patch and test patch; Python repository checkout at a pinned base commit with executable tests.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ Executable regression tests and environment checks; no learned reward model is part of the data release.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: unknown as a single teacher; released expert trajectories use listed frontier-model SWE-agent runs.; generator: SWE-smith.prog transforms existing Python functions, while SWE-smith.gen uses language models to generate new functions/classes after environment setup; exact generator model names require paper/code audit.
  _Audit focus:_ Generated tests can encode shallow or brittle specifications., Repository environment failures can be mistaken for task difficulty., Training on synthetic SWE tasks may overfit to generator artifacts rather than real issue distributions.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a concrete recipe for scaling software-engineering agent data with executable tests, released code, and dataset artifacts, making it useful for studying construction pipelines rather than only benchmark scores.

  _Data object:_ step-level rollout-value labels; process: reasoning step, rollout result, process reward score; offline math reasoning traces
  _Feedback / verifier:_ rollout-derived process reward signal
  _Recipe signal:_ generator: model rollouts from intermediate reasoning steps; filtering rule: rollout success rate converted to step reward
  _Audit focus:_ rollout policy strength can leak into labels, step rewards may favor locally plausible continuations, generated solutions can inherit base-model shortcuts
  _Why it matters:_ It is the clearest bridge between final-answer verifiers and step-level PRM data: the label is not a human judgment but a rollout-derived estimate of whether a partial step can still reach the right answer.

## 6. What to Audit

- Does the claim improve asymptote, sample efficiency, or inference budget allocation?
- Are pass@k, rollout budget, verifier refresh, and reuse count reported?
- Can data scale be separated from test-time compute scale?

## 7. Open Problems

- What is the right unit of reasoning-data scale: prompt, trace, rollout, verified answer, or environment episode?
- How should RLVR reports disclose verifier false positives?
- Can data scale and test-time compute scale be disentangled cleanly?
- How much reuse is acceptable before benchmark claims become fragile?
