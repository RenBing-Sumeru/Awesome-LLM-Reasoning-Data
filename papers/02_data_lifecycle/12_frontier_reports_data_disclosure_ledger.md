## 1. What This Track Studies

Use this track to read frontier model reports as partial data-disclosure documents rather than only model-performance announcements.

Frontier reasoning reports shape the field even when they do not release full data. They disclose hints about SFT mixtures, distillation, RLVR rewards, verifier contracts, safety tuning, rejection sampling, inference budgets, and evaluation practices. This track turns those hints into a disclosure ledger.

The goal is not to overclaim hidden recipes. The page should separate what is disclosed, what is inferred, and what remains unknown. That distinction is essential for a trusted Awesome project.

Contributors should tag frontier reports across data types and lifecycle stages while using this track to summarize the report-level disclosure quality.

## 2. Why It Matters for Post-Training Reasoning Data

Read this page as a data map, not only a bibliography. For each paper, ask what record is being produced, what feedback contract makes it trainable or evaluable, how it could enter SFT/RM/PRM/RLVR/agent training, and which audit failure would make the claim misleading.

## 3. Subfield Navigator

| Subfield | What it helps you read | Key audit risk |
|---|---|---|
| 🚀 DeepSeek-R1 family | RLVR, distillation, reasoning traces, and public recipe disclosure | report describes outcomes but not enough data partitions |
| 🌙 Kimi reasoning reports | long-context reasoning, RL compute, and frontier inference budgets | test-time compute is mixed with training-data effects |
| 🐉 Qwen reasoning/math/code reports | math, code, PRM, and open-weight reasoning model families | release cards do not separate SFT, RLVR, and evaluation data |
| 🧠 Magistral / Phi / Nemotron style reports | open-weight reasoning reports with partial data and reward disclosures | model-card claims cannot be mapped to concrete data objects |
| 🧪 RLVR recipe reports | reports that expose reward contracts, rollout policies, or RL scaffolds | RL gains are attributed without verifier coverage |
| 🧬 What is disclosed vs hidden | data sources, filters, lineage, safety mixtures, and undisclosed partitions | opaque mixtures are reused as open recipes |

  _Feedback / verifier:_ coding benchmark pass rates and optional executable checks.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: GPT-3.5-series teacher model for synthetic instruction generation.; generator: OSS-Instruct prompts the teacher with open-source code snippets.
  _Audit focus:_ Synthetic code tasks can inherit license issues., Reference snippets may leak benchmark patterns., Teacher-generated solutions can be plausible but wrong.
  _Why it matters:_ It is a strong code-data construction example because it grounds synthetic coding instructions in real open-source references rather than free-floating prompt invention.

  _Data object:_ instruction response with detailed explanation, intermediate reasoning, and final answer.; process: prompt source, teacher identity, explanation trace, task type, response, evaluation benchmark.; offline synthetic-data distillation and evaluation pipeline.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ downstream reasoning, exam, and benchmark evaluation rather than a single automatic verifier.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: large foundation models that produce explanation traces and stepwise guidance.; generator: teacher-assisted data-generation pipeline over diverse instructions.
  _Audit focus:_ Students can learn teacher style without robust reasoning., Synthetic traces can include teacher errors., Closed teacher data makes lineage hard to audit.
  _Why it matters:_ It is an early and influential reasoning-distillation recipe: the reusable object is teacher-assisted explanation data plus careful evaluation against style-only imitation.

  _Data object:_ math problem, reference solution/answer, generated reasoning traces, final answer, and correctness fields; process: problem, solution, answer; Offline Hugging Face parquet dataset generated through the Open R1 reproduction pipeline.
  _Feedback / verifier:_ Math-Verify answer checking plus Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct judge recovery for cases Math-Verify did not verify.
  _Recipe signal:_ teacher: DeepSeek-R1.; generator: Open R1 generation pipeline using SGLang/vLLM-style large-scale inference.
  _Audit focus:_ Math answer parsing can reject correct answers or accept format-compatible wrong answers., Llama judge recovery introduces judgment-required behavior into an otherwise programmatic pipeline., Only accepted/correct traces are emphasized, so failed traces and ambiguity are not equally visible.
  _Why it matters:_ The release makes the Open R1 reproduction effort concrete as a dataset with prompts, generated traces, correctness fields, split metadata, and filtering signals exposed enough for L4 card-level reuse and audit planning.

## 6. What to Audit

- Which data partitions and reward contracts are actually disclosed?
- Can model gains be attributed to data, optimizer, scaffold, or inference budget?
- Are distillation, RLVR, safety, and chat data separated?

## 7. Open Problems

- What should a standard frontier-report data-disclosure table include?
- How can open projects cite frontier reports without overstating hidden details?
- Which disclosed fields are most predictive of reproducibility?
- How should model-family updates be versioned in the atlas?
